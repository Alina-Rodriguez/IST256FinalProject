# IST256FinalProject

## The original HTML page was retrieved from nicepage.com. I downloaded the template and edited the webpage to include the elements I wanted using the nicepage application. The original webpage can be found at: https://nicepage.com/s/749343/household-products-css-template 

## I added two rows of products for my line, a full image, and a half image half text block. I decided that I wanted my page to be a single page, and as the template included a home, about and contact page, I deleted those links. Then I realized that the webpage was not using bootstrap, and to incorporate it into the preexisitng code may be a lot of work. I tried to find another template online that utilized bootstrap, and I really struggled. Once I had spent too much time looking, I decided to cut my losses and rebuild the main part of the webpage from scratch using bootstrap. The only code original to the template is the header and footer code.
