# IST256FinalProject

## The original HTML page was retrieved from nicepage.com. I downloaded the template and edited the webpage to include the elements I wanted using the nicepage application. The original webpage can be found at: https://nicepage.com/s/749343/household-products-css-template 

## I added two rows of products for my line, a full image, and a half image half text block. I decided that I wanted my page to be a single page, and as the template imcluded a home, about and contact page, I deleted those links.
