# IST256FinalProject

## The original HTML page was retrieved from nicepage.com. I downloaded the template and edited the webpage to include the elements I wanted using the nicepage application. The original webpage can be found at: https://nicepage.com/s/749343/household-products-css-template 

## I added two rows of products for my line, a full image, and a half image half text block.
